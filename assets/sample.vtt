00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
If you only have 24 hours in a day,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.339
your success is dependent upon how you use the 24.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.040
You gotta hear me.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.640
People talk about open, wren free,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.720
you know, care, turn, or warm buffet.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.560
Listen to me.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.040
I don't care how much money you make.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.920
You only get 24 hours in a day.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.240
And the difference between Oprah and the person that's broke

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.800
is Oprah uses her 24 hours wisely.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.199
That's it. Listen to me.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.960
That's it. You get 24.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
I don't care if you broke, you grew up broke.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.039
I don't care if you grew up rich.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.560
I don't care if you're in college.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.600
You're not in college.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.359
You only get 24 hours.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.920
And I blew up literally.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.679
I went from being a high school dropout

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.040
to selling six thousand books and less than six months.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.880
What happened?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.679
My 24 hours.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.960
I was like, okay, Eric, you gotta get a grip on your 24 hours

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.159
because you're about to be broke for the rest of your life.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.719
And that's all I need you to do for me.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.640
I can tell you all about your life.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.079
If you just write down your 24 hours schedule for me,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.920
you let me look at it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.519
I can tell you where you're going to be in five years.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:00.920
I can tell you where you're going to be in 10 years.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.199
I can tell you where you're going to be in 20 years

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.519
if you keep that schedule.
