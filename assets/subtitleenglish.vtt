From Speak English with Class

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey everyone, welcome back to the EnglishLeap Podcast.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're go to English Podcast for learning English and improving your life.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm Aaron, and as always, I'm joined by my fantastic co-host, Evan.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Evan, how are you doing today?

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Hey Aaron, I'm doing great.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Feeling energized and ready for today's topic.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
How about you?

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm doing well too.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know, I had this moment yesterday where I just sat down and thought,

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
why does it feel like some people completely turn their lives around

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
while others stay stuck in the same place?

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Oh, I've had that thought too.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You see someone go from struggling to successful, and you wonder,

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
what's their secret?

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Are they just lucky? Or is there something they're doing differently?

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Exactly.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And then I started thinking about when I was learning English.

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
At first, it felt impossible.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So many words, so many rules.

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But then, little by little, things started making sense.

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's so true.

24
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When I first started learning, I kept thinking,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if I just knew more words, I'd be fluent.

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But it wasn't just about vocabulary.

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was about building habits, changing my mindset,

28
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and actually using what I learned.

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And that's when it hit me.

30
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Life is the same way.

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Big transformations don't happen overnight.

32
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's not about one huge decision.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's about the little changes we make every day.

34
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And that's exactly what we're talking about today.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
How to change your life.

36
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And before we jump in, we have something special for you.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We've created a free PDF packed with practical exercises

38
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to help you take real steps to change your life.

39
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It includes key takeaways from today's discussion,

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
comprehension questions, to test your understanding,

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and grammar exercises to build confidence in your English skills.

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And that's not all.

43
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We're also introducing some intermediate level words

44
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and phrases in today's episode.

45
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's right.

46
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we'll take a closer look at them later

47
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
in Charlotte's vocabulary section,

48
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
where Charlotte will break down those words and phrases,

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
explain their meaning, and show how to use them

50
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in real life conversations.

51
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So stick around.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
By the end of this episode,

53
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
not only will you have practical steps to change your life,

54
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but you'll also have new English vocabulary

55
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to help you express your ideas even better.

56
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You know, Aaron, thinking about what we just talked about,

57
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
how life changes little by little.

58
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It makes me wonder why so many people struggle

59
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to make those changes in the first place.

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That's a great question.

61
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Change sounds exciting, right?

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
A fresh start, a new beginning.

63
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But here's the truth.

64
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Most people never actually make those changes.

65
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Why?

66
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Because change is hard.

67
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Let's talk about the common reasons people feel stuck.

68
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Yeah.

69
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
First, there is fear of failure.

70
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Many people ask,

71
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
what if I try and fail?

72
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But what if you try and succeed?

73
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Every successful person has failed along the way.

74
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The difference is, they kept going.

75
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Exactly.

76
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The second reason is lack of direction.

77
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Some people know they want a better life,

78
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but don't know where to start.

79
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They think they need a perfect plan before taking action.

80
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And then there's negative self-talk,

81
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
saying things like,

82
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I'll never be good at this,

83
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
or I'm just not a language person.

84
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
These thoughts stop progress before it even begins.

85
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Finally, one of the biggest traps, waiting for motivation.

86
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
People say,

87
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'll start when I feel ready.

88
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But here's a secret.

89
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Motivation comes after action,

90
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and I've never been a person who's not before.

91
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
That reminds me of when I struggled with a personal challenge.

92
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I kept waiting for the perfect moment to start,

93
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but that moment never came,

94
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
until I just took the first step.

95
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And once I did,

96
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
everything started falling into place.

97
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That's a great point.

98
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I remember feeling the same when I was learning English.

99
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
At first, I thought,

100
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm not good at this.

101
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But then I realized,

102
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the only way to get better was to actually start practicing.

103
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Exactly. And that brings us to our key lesson.

104
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Understanding what's holding you back

105
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
is the first step to changing your life.

106
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Once you recognize these barriers,

107
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
you can start working on breaking them down.

108
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, Evan,

109
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
now that we understand what holds people back,

110
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
the next big question is,

111
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
how do we actually start making those changes?

112
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
That's where small daily improvements come in.

113
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
People often think they need a dramatic transformation overnight.

114
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But real change happens gradually.

115
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Have you heard of the 1% rule?

116
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yes.

117
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If you improve just 1% every day,

118
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you'll be 37 times better in a year.

119
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's because small efforts compound over time,

120
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
just like interest in a bank account.

121
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Exactly. And that ties into the power of habits.

122
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
James Clear talks about this in atomic habits.

123
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
How habits shape our identity?

124
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Small changes may not seem big at first,

125
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
but they redefine who you are over time.

126
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Right.

127
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Like reading just 10 minutes a day,

128
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
practicing English for 5 minutes daily,

129
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
or even replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations.

130
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I love real life examples.

131
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I know someone who became fluent in English

132
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
just by listening to podcasts every day.

133
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
They didn't start with an intense study plan,

134
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
just consistent small steps.

135
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That's so inspiring.

136
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The takeaway here is,

137
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
small consistent actions lead to big results over time.

138
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So if you're listening and wondering where to start,

139
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
just pick one small habit today.

140
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Exactly.

141
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And you know, Aaron, while taking action is important,

142
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
there's something even more fundamental, our mindset.

143
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Because let's be honest,

144
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
how we think about change makes all the difference.

145
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Absolutely.

146
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
There's something called the growth mindset versus fixed mindset.

147
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
If you have a growth mindset, you believe I can improve.

148
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But if you have a fixed mindset,

149
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you think I'll never be good at this.

150
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That's a huge difference.

151
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And another thing,

152
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
our brain is wired to focus on what we train it to notice.

153
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Have you heard of the reticular activating system?

154
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Yes.

155
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It's why when you learn a new word,

156
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
you suddenly hear it everywhere.

157
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Your brain filters information based on what you focus on.

158
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So if you keep telling yourself,

159
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I can't do this.

160
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Your brain will find evidence to prove it.

161
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But if you say,

162
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I am improving every day,

163
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
your brain will focus on that progress instead.

164
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That's why reprogramming your mind is so powerful.

165
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Three great ways to do that are affirmations,

166
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
visualization, and gratitude.

167
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Right.

168
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Positive self-talk like,

169
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I am getting better every day,

170
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
helps reshape our thoughts.

171
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Visualization, seeing yourself succeed,

172
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
tricks your brain into believing it's possible.

173
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And don't forget gratitude practice.

174
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
When you focus on what's going well,

175
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
you train your brain to see opportunities instead of obstacles.

176
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
That's the power of mindset.

177
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It's not magic.

178
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It's about training your brain to work for you,

179
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
not against you.

180
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So true.

181
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Now that we've talked about the power of mindset,

182
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
there's something else that holds people back,

183
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
waiting for the right moment to start.

184
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Yes.

185
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So many people believe that they need to be completely ready

186
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
before they take action.

187
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But here's the truth.

188
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You will never feel fully ready.

189
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Exactly.

190
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Progress comes before confidence.

191
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
When I was learning English,

192
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I hesitated to start speaking

193
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because I felt like I wasn't ready.

194
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I kept thinking,

195
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
what if I make mistakes?

196
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But the more I waited, the harder it became.

197
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
That's so relatable.

198
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
But when you finally took that first step, what happened?

199
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Well, once I started speaking,

200
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I realized that making mistakes was part of the learning process.

201
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Each conversation, even with errors, built my confidence.

202
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I wasn't perfect, but I was improving.

203
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And that's the key.

204
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There's a concept I love.

205
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Done is better than perfect.

206
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Too many people delay action

207
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
because they want everything to be just right.

208
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
But in reality, imperfect action is always better than no action.

209
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Right.

210
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
If you wait for perfection, you'll never get started.

211
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Whether it's learning English, starting a new habit,

212
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
or making a big life change.

213
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Just begin.

214
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Small steps will lead to big improvements over time.

215
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So here's a quick challenge for you, our listeners.

216
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Think of one thing you've been postponing.

217
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It could be practicing English, starting a workout routine,

218
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
or even reaching out to someone for help.

219
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And then, just take one small step today.

220
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Not tomorrow, not next week.

221
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Today.

222
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Because action leads to momentum,

223
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and momentum leads to confidence.

224
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That's right.

225
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Small, consistent actions over time create massive change.

226
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So don't wait for the perfect moment.

227
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Make today the day you start.

228
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Speaking of taking action,

229
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
have you ever noticed how much our surroundings shape our habits and decisions?

230
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It's not just about what we do,

231
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
but who and what we surround ourselves with.

232
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Absolutely.

233
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The people you surround yourself with,

234
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the content you consume,

235
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and the mindset you adopt all play a huge role in shaping your life.

236
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Yes.

237
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
There's a famous saying,

238
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.

239
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If you're surrounded by negative, unmotivated people,

240
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
it's hard to stay motivated.

241
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But if you're around positive,

242
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
gold-driven individuals,

243
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
their energy and habits will rub off on you.

244
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's so true.

245
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So how can we create an environment that supports growth?

246
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
First, start by following inspirational people,

247
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
whether it's authors, speakers, or even social media accounts,

248
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
exposing yourself to positive influences will shift your mindset over time.

249
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Absolutely.

250
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And joining online learning communities is another great way to stay motivated.

251
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
There are so many groups out there for English learners,

252
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
book clubs, and personal development.

253
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
When you're part of a community that values growth,

254
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you naturally start improving too.

255
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And just as important as adding positive influences

256
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is reducing exposure to negativity.

257
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That could mean limiting time spent with people who constantly complain,

258
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
or even cutting down on negative news and social media that drain your energy.

259
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
That reminds me of when I was learning English.

261
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I felt stuck until I joined an English learning community.

262
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Suddenly, I had people to practice with,

263
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
share struggles, and celebrate progress.

264
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
That made all the difference.

265
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That's such a great example.

266
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The right environment creates momentum,

267
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
making it easier to grow and stay on track.

268
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So, here's something to think about.

269
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Who are the five people you spend the most time with?

270
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Are they helping you grow, or are they holding you back?

271
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
If they're not pushing you to be better,

272
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
it might be time to make some adjustments.

273
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Surround yourself with people and influences that inspire and uplift you.

274
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And speaking of inspiration, sometimes learning new words and phrases

275
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
can help us articulate our goals and mindset even better.

276
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
That's why we have Charlotte here to break down some key vocabulary from today's discussion.

277
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Absolutely. Take it away, Charlotte.

278
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Hello, English learners.

279
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It's time for Charlotte's vocabulary breakdown.

280
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
In today's episode, Erin and Evan introduced some great concepts about change,

281
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
mindset, and environment.

282
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Let's take a closer look at some key vocabulary and how to use them in real-life conversations.

283
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Transformation.

284
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Meaning. A big change in something.

285
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Example. After years of hard work, Maria experienced a complete transformation in her career,

286
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
going from an intern to a company director.

287
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Mindset. Meaning. The way you think about things.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Surroundings. Meaning. The things and people around you.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Momentum. Meaning. The force that keeps something moving.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Example. Once Daniel started writing 500 words a day, he built momentum and finished his book in just three months.

293
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Exposure. Meaning. The amount of contact you have with something.

294
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Example. Watching English movies increased Sarah's exposure to native speech, improving her listening skills.

295
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Growth-driven. Meaning. Focused on improvement.

296
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Example. Leo joined a growth-driven study group that encouraged him to keep learning and setting new goals.

297
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Visualization. Meaning. The formation of a mental image of something often used to enhance motivation, confidence, and performance.

298
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000

299
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Affirmation. Meaning. A positive statement to encourage yourself.

300
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Example. Jane starts her day with the affirmation. I am capable and strong.

301
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Community. Meaning. A group of people with shared interests.

302
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Example. David found an amazing community of runners who motivated him to complete his first marathon.

303
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Accountable. Meaning. Responsibility for your own progress.

304
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Example. Mia set weekly goals for herself and tracked her progress to stay accountable in her fitness journey.

305
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
That's it for today's vocabulary breakdown. Back to you, Erin and Evan.

306
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Thank you, Charlotte. Those were some really useful words and phrases.

307
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So, Evan, if we had to leave our listeners with one key takeaway from today's episode, what would it be?

308
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I'd say it's this. You have more control over your life than you think.

309
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Small changes, the right mindset, and a strong environment can completely transform your life.

310
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
That's so true. And remember, progress doesn't happen overnight, but every step you take gets you closer to where you want to be.
